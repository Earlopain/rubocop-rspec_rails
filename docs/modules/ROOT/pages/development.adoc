= Development

This page describes considerations when developing RSpec Rails-specific cops. It is intended to be a complement to the general https://docs.rubocop.org/rubocop/development.html[RuboCop development documentation].

== Create a new cop

NOTE: Clone the repository and run `bundle install` if not done yet.
The following rake task can only be run inside the rubocop project directory itself.

Use the bundled rake task `new_cop` to generate a cop template:

[source,sh]
----
$ bundle exec rake 'new_cop[RSpecRails/CopName]'
[create] lib/rubocop/cop/rspec_rails/cop_name.rb
[create] spec/rubocop/cop/rspec_rails/cop_name_spec.rb
[modify] lib/rubocop/cop/rspec_rails_cops.rb - `require_relative 'rspec_rails/cop_name'` was injected.
[modify] A configuration for the cop is added into config/default.yml.
Do 4 steps:
  1. Modify the description of RSpecRails/CopName in config/default.yml
  2. Implement your new cop in the generated file!
  3. Add an entry about new cop to CHANGELOG.md
  4. Commit your new cop with a message such as
     e.g. "Add new `#{badge}` cop"
----

=== Choose a Name

Use the following rules to give the new cop a name:

* Pick a department. See the xref:cops.adoc[list of existing departments]
* The name is self-explanatory
* The name explains the offense the cop detects, e.g. `ExtraSpacing`
* The name starts with a noun instead of a verb, e.g. `ArrayAlignment` instead of `AlignArray`
* The name is easy to understand, e.g. `IndentationStyle` instead of just `Tab`
* The name is specific, e.g. `DuplicateHashKey` instead of just `DuplicateKey`
* The name is neutral when possible and accommodates multiple styles when feasible, e.g. `EmptyLineBeforeBegin`.
* The name uses commonly-used terms, e.g. `RedundantPercentI` instead of `RedundantPercentSymbolArray`
* The name uses correct terms, e.g. arguments in a method call, and parameters in a method signature
* Lines with no symbols are called "empty", not "blank", e.g. `LeadingEmptyLines` instead of `LeadingBlankLines`
* Prefer "redundant" to "unneeded", e.g. `RedundantSelf` instead of `UnneededSelf`

See the https://github.com/rubocop/rubocop/blob/12fd014e255617a08b7b42aa5df0745e7382af88/config/obsoletion.yml#L4["renamed" section of `config/obsoletion.yml`]
for good and bad examples (old name is on the left, new name on the right).
